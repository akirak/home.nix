* Home-Manager Configuration
[[https://circleci.com/gh/akirak/home.nix][https://circleci.com/gh/akirak/home.nix.svg?style=svg]]

My home configuration using [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manager]]

This is part of [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d][my Emacs configuration]].

** Installation
This is automatically installed as part of the Emacs configuration. Alternatively, you can use it without Emacs. If you have already added [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manager]] to your Nix channels, you can install it by running

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/akirak/home.nix.git ~/nix
  cd ~/nix
  git submodule update --init
  # Create a symbolic link to one of the identity.*.nix files
  ln -s identity.chromeos.nix identity.nix
  nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
  make all
#+end_src

Before running =make=, you have to create =identity.nix=. There are some profiles which follow the naming convention of =identity.*.nix= in this repository, so you can use one of them by creating a symbolic link.

** Development
Tests are run automatically by a Git hook.

To remove the hook

#+begin_src sh
make uninstall-hooks
#+end_src

To run the tests manually

#+begin_src sh
sh test/test-local.sh
#+end_src
