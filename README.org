* My home-manager configuration
*I no longer maintain this repository.*

First, install Nix.
You can use a script contained in this repository:

#+begin_src sh
bash ./install-nix.sh
#+end_src

You will need a local configuration in =~/local/identity.nix=.
Copy =identity.sample.nix= to the directory and modify it.

Perform an initial installation of home-manager using the following command:

#+begin_src sh
nix-shell --command 'make install'
#+end_src

Switch the configuration by running the following command:

#+begin_src sh
nix-shell --command 'make home-manager'
#+end_src
